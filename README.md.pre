Dotfiles
========

üè† Personal dotfiles for \*NIX (Mac OS X and Linux) systems.

Installation
------------

### Clone and Install!

One-liner (if, you trust):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://<<:REPO_ADDR>>/etc/install | bash
```

An alternative:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/<<:USER_NAME>>/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles && python install.py
```
<!--
Note: The option `-j8` (`--jobs 8`) works with Git >= 2.8 (parallel submodule fetching).
For older versions of Git, try without `-j` option.
-->

The installation script will create symbolic links for the specified dotfiles.
If some target file already exists (e.g. `~/.vim`), you will need to manually resolve the conflict (delete the old one or just ignore).

### `dotfiles`

Update (pull the changes from upstream and run `install.py` again)

```
$ dotfiles update
```


### `install.py`

This is a clunky installation script written in python;
the task definition lies on the top of the script file.


Some Handy URLs
---------------

Every file is accessible through `<<:REPO_ADDR>>` (via `curl -L` or `wget`), e.g.

* https://<<:REPO_ADDR>>/vimrc
* https://<<:REPO_ADDR>>/vimrc?raw=true
* https://<<:REPO_ADDR>>/bin/tb


Troubleshooting
---------------

* Powerline characters not displayed properly? Install [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
* Does vim color look weird (e.g. black-and-white)? Check your terminal emulator supports [24-bit color](https://github.com/wookayin/dotfiles/pull/9).
* Ruby version is shown unwantedly? A simple workaround might be to install [rvm](https://rvm.io/).
* Does `tmux` look weird? Make sure that tmux version is [2.3](etc/ubuntu-setup.sh) or higher.
* If you are using neovim, make sure that the [`neovim`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/neovim/) pypi package is installed on [**local** python 3](https://github.com/<<:REPO_ADDR>>/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/init.vim);
  e.g. `/usr/local/bin/pip3 install neovim` where the path to `pip` depends on your system.
